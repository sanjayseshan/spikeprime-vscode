/**
 * Accepts an `Array` of {@link ObservableInput} or a dictionary `Object` of {@link ObservableInput} and returns
 * an {@link Observable} that emits either an array of values in the exact same order as the passed array,
 * or a dictionary of values in the same shape as the passed dictionary.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Wait for Observables to complete and then combine last values they emitted.</span>
 *
 * ![](forkJoin.png)
 *
 * `forkJoin` is an operator that takes any number of input observables which can be passed either as an array
 * or a dictionary of input observables. If no input observables are provided, resulting stream will complete
 * immediately.
 *
 * `forkJoin` will wait for all passed observables to complete and then it will emit an array or an object with last
 * values from corresponding observables.
 *
 * If you pass an array of `n` observables to the operator, resulting
 * array will have `n` values, where first value is the last thing emitted by the first observable,
 * second value is the last thing emitted by the second observable and so on.
 *
 * If you pass a dictionary of observables to the operator, resulting
 * objects will have the same keys as the dictionary passed, with their last values they've emitted
 * located at the corresponding key.
 *
 * That means `forkJoin` will not emit more than once and it will complete after that. If you need to emit combined
 * values not only at the end of lifecycle of passed observables, but also throughout it, try out {@link combineLatest}
 * or {@link zip} instead.
 *
 * In order for resulting array to have the same length as the number of input observables, whenever any of
 * that observables completes without emitting any value, `forkJoin` will complete at that moment as well
 * and it will not emit anything either, even if it already has some last values from other observables.
 * Conversely, if there is an observable that never completes, `forkJoin` will never complete as well,
 * unless at any point some other observable completes without emitting value, which brings us back to
 * the previous case. Overall, in order for `forkJoin` to emit a value, all observables passed as arguments
 * have to emit something at least once and complete.
 *
 * If any input observable errors at some point, `forkJoin` will error as well and all other observables
 * will be immediately unsubscribed.
 *
 * Optionally `forkJoin` accepts project function, that will be called with values which normally
 * would land in emitted array. Whatever is returned by project function, will appear in output
 * observable instead. This means that default project can be thought of as a function that takes
 * all its arguments and puts them into an array. Note that project function will be called only
 * when output observable is supposed to emit a result.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * ### Use forkJoin with a dictionary of observable inputs
 * ```ts
 * import { forkJoin, of, timer } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * const observable = forkJoin({
 *   foo: of(1, 2, 3, 4),
 *   bar: Promise.resolve(8),
 *   baz: timer(4000),
 * });
 * observable.subscribe({
 *  next: value => console.log(value),
 *  complete: () => console.log('This is how it ends!'),
 * });
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // { foo: 4, bar: 8, baz: 0 } after 4 seconds
 * // "This is how it ends!" immediately after
 * ```
 *
 * ### Use forkJoin with an array of observable inputs
 * ```ts
 * import { forkJoin, of } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * const observable = forkJoin([
 *   of(1, 2, 3, 4),
 *   Promise.resolve(8),
 *   timer(4000),
 * ]);
 * observable.subscribe({
 *  next: value => console.log(value),
 *  complete: () => console.log('This is how it ends!'),
 * });
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // [4, 8, 0] after 4 seconds
 * // "This is how it ends!" immediately after
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link combineLatest}
 * @see {@link zip}
 *
 * @param {...ObservableInput} sources Any number of Observables provided either as an array or as an arguments
 * passed directly to the operator.
 * @param {function} [project] Function that takes values emitted by input Observables and returns value
 * that will appear in resulting Observable instead of default array.
 * @return {Observable} Observable emitting either an array of last values emitted by passed Observables
 * or value from project function.
