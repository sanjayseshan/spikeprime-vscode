/**
 * Emits a value from the source Observable only after a particular time span
 * determined by another Observable has passed without another source emission.
 *
 * <span class="informal">It's like {@link debounceTime}, but the time span of
 * emission silence is determined by a second Observable.</span>
 *
 * ![](debounce.png)
 *
 * `debounce` delays values emitted by the source Observable, but drops previous
 * pending delayed emissions if a new value arrives on the source Observable.
 * This operator keeps track of the most recent value from the source
 * Observable, and spawns a duration Observable by calling the
 * `durationSelector` function. The value is emitted only when the duration
 * Observable emits a value or completes, and if no other value was emitted on
 * the source Observable since the duration Observable was spawned. If a new
 * value appears before the duration Observable emits, the previous value will
 * be dropped and will not be emitted on the output Observable.
 *
 * Like {@link debounceTime}, this is a rate-limiting operator, and also a
 * delay-like operator since output emissions do not necessarily occur at the
 * same time as they did on the source Observable.
 *
 * ## Example
 * Emit the most recent click after a burst of clicks
 * ```ts
 * import { fromEvent, interval } from 'rxjs';
 * import { debounce } from 'rxjs/operators';
 *
 * const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * const result = clicks.pipe(debounce(() => interval(1000)));
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link audit}
 * @see {@link debounceTime}
 * @see {@link delayWhen}
 * @see {@link throttle}
 *
 * @param {function(value: T): SubscribableOrPromise} durationSelector A function
 * that receives a value from the source Observable, for computing the timeout
 * duration for each source value, returned as an Observable or a Promise.
 * @return {Observable} An Observable that delays the emissions of the source
 * Observable by the specified duration Observable returned by
 * `durationSelector`, and may drop some values if they occur too frequently.
